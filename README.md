Accessible Hamburger Button & Navigation
================

jQuery script to open/close a hamburger navigation.

Without JavaScript, the navigation gracefully degrades to be persistently open and the hamburger button is hidden from all users.

An option exists to add a page overlay and trap focus within the navigation, while it's open, by adding ```data-has-overlay="true"``` to the hamburger button.  This will also add a class of ```.pause-document-scroll``` to the ```<html>``` element, negating scrolling on desktop browsers.
