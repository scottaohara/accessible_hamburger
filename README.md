Accessible Hamburger Button & Navigation
================

jQuery script to open/close a hamburger navigation.

Without JavaScript, the navigation gracefully degrades to be persistently open and the hamburger button is hidden from all users.

An option exists to add a page overlay and trap focus within the navigation, while it's open, by adding ```data-has-overlay="true"``` to the hamburger button.  This will also add a class of ```.pause-document-scroll``` to the ```<html>``` element, negating scrolling on desktop browsers.


## Note:

The CSS needs to be further optimized and better documented to indicate what is important for this component in general, and what is only necessary for this specific implementation of the script.  more to come here...
