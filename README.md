Accessible Hamburger Button & Navigation
================

Progressively enhanced, vanilla JavaScript, off-screen navigation & hamburger menu button.

Without JavaScript, the menu is opened using the CSS ```:target```.

With JavaScript enabled, the menu is opened & closed by toggling the navigation's ```[data-state]``` attribute.  Keyboard tabbing is then trapped to the navigation and is released back to the document once the close button has been triggered.
